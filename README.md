# Frosted Glass for YouTube's HTML5 Player  
### [Install it on userstyles.org](https://userstyles.org/styles/131768/youtube-player-frosted-glass)

A YouTube Player Skin which gives tooltips and menus a frosted glass blur effect. Currently works with Safari, Chrome, and Opera.

Safari currently supports this style by default.

Microsoft Edge supports this style from version 42 onwards. (Neither Stylish nor Stylus currently offer a stable port for Edge, so this style must be installed as a userscript instead.)

In order to make this style work in Chrome or Opera, you must enable the flag, *#enable-experimental-web-platform-features*:  
* Chrome: *chrome://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features*
* Opera: *opera://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features*
